# Stellar Populations Widget

Demonstrates the various models of star formation history for a given stellar population and how stellar mass evolves over cosmic time. The stellar populations are normalized and the total stellar mass created is set to 1e12 solar masses. The evolution of the population can be observed by how red or blue the population is, quantified by the B-V color for different tau and metallicity values.
